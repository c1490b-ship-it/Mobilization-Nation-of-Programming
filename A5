AI Mobilization is a framework for deploying, managing, and scaling AI models across cloud, edge, and hybrid environments. This is the "post-deployment" phase where AI models are mobilized for production use.

## Features
- **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to AWS, GCP, Azure, or hybrid
- **6G-Ready Architecture**: Simulated next-gen network optimization  
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track model performance and health
- **Team Collaboration**: Built for distributed teams

## Quick Start
```python
from mobilizer.orchestrator import AIMobilizationOrchestrator

mobilizer = AIMobilizationOrchestrator()
result = await mobilizer.mobilize_ai_model("path/to/model", "cloud")
